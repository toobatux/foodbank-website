CS-355 PROJECT: FOODBANK RAZORPAGES WEB APPLICATION -----

This project was created by myself for CS-355 Software Engineering using ASP.NET Core, RazorPages, and Bootstrap v4.


Guide:

After creating an account, users may login to view, join, or create events for a local food bank!

User roles are created and assigned through the 'User Roles' pages - which is linked in the footer. This is important for creating events, as this is reserved for administrators.

Since the application is not currently live, the 'User Roles' page is open for any account to explore. Create an 'ADMIN' role, assign it to your account, and try creating a new event!

Events may be created, edited, and deleted. Users may also join and leave events, which is reflected in the member count on each event. When creating an event, the title, date and time, location, description, and the required volunteer count may be specified to minimize uncertainty!
